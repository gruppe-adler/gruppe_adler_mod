### houseLightSwitch

ACE self interact menu to switch all lights in a house. Requires player to be in and reasonably close to the house center.

To test, move into a house that has lights - for example "Land_House_C_3_EP1" or "Land_House_C_9_EP1". Terrains containing these buildings are Zargabad or Uzbin_Valley . Be close to the center of the house. Self interact should now contain a "switch house lights off" entry.
